# FindFace

Repo Link: https://github.com/charliem61/FindFace


Goal/Motivation:

To create an application using MongoDB that will help me learn to structure an API with POST, PUT, and DELETE routes within Insomnia. This will in turn allow me to create, update, and delete users thoughts in the database.

Problems Solved:

With my code I am able to create users & thoughts. Delete users & thoughts, as well as update users & thoughts all using post, put, and delete routes within insomnia.

The Standouts:

It works correctly. It meets the grading criteria. Also after much elapsed time trying to obtain sharable screen recordings that were clipped and long enough to show the whole app, I ended up making a youtube channel for these videos to be easily viewable by Graders in the future out of my own frustration.

Challenges Faced:

Making the demonstation videos and its their SEVERAL takes to get a decent set of clips good enough to share.
